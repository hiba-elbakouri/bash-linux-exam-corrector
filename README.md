# Exam corrector
it's a python script capable of correcting the bash linux exam files of
multiple candidates
## What does the script do ?

1. extract all the exam files of the candidates to a specific destination
2. iterate over each exam folder
3. verify the existence of the files: 'cron.txt', 'sales.txt' and 'exam.sh'
4. examine the content of each of those files and check if it's correct
   - the "cron.txt" file is examined by checking the validity of the cron configuration using the package 
   croniter
   - the "out.txt" file is examined by performing a regex matching verifying if the content is a sequence
     of this structure taking into consideration that the GPU order could change):
      ```bash
        datetime
          rtx3060: number
          rtx3070: number
          rtx3080: number
          rtx3090: number
          rx6700: number
      ```
5. run the GPU API in background and execute the 'exam.sh' script
   keeping its output in a second output file 'sales_2.txt' whose content will be
   compared to the content of 'sales.txt'
6. show the result of the exams of all candidates in a table
7. clean the project by deleting extracted files and folders

## TODO
1. compare the content of 'sales.txt ' to the file generated by 'exam.sh' script taking into 
   consideration that the datetimes and amount of GPU sales may vary
2. use asyncio to perform multiple corrections simultaneously to be able to handle a large amount  
   of exam file.
3. write more unit tests involving many versions of correct and incorrect exams to 
   assure the correctness of the script increasing the coverage score 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hiba-elbakouri/bash-linux-exam-corrector.git
    ```

2. create new virtual env envrionmenet:

    ```bash
    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    ```
   
3. activate this virtual envrionmenet:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. install requirements.txt:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

    ```bash
